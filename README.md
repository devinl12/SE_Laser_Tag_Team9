# Team 9 Laser Tag Project  

This repository features Team 9's code for our Laser Tag SWE project.
To run the code:
First run: *cd /home/student/SE_Laser_Tag_Team9/src*
This will get you to the right directory
Then run: *bash build.bash*
This should bring up our game

For Team: If you want to test the code using the traffic generator there are a few steps:
1. Download the photon-main/udp_files/python_trafficgenarator_v2.py off of jstrother123.
2. Put it in a folder and run it using python3 traffic_generator.py
3. Run our actual game (so 2 programs will be running)
